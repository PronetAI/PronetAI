# Welcome to Pronet's Github Page!
Hi everyone, I am a software programmer and a electrical hardware enthuisast. I mainly program in Python (pygame, flask, pymongo), C/C++, HTML, CSS, and Dart + Flutter. I spend a lot of time devolping and creating solutions using Arduino Microcontroller boards. In this profile, I program solutions and simplfy hard concepts to easy to manipulate interfaces. I also make fun programs that showcase real world applications.
## Projects
- ANN Alpha: The ANN Alpha is a program that is revolutionizing the Machine Learning world. We have finally made the worlds first lightweight Machine Learning algorithm for microcontrollers. It is very easy to use and can be modified easily and customized per your needs.
  ```c
  const byte Target[PatternCount][Output_Nodes] = {{ 0, 0, 0, 0 }, { 0, 0, 0, 1 }, { 0, 0, 1, 0 }, { 0, 0, 1, 1 }, { 0, 1, 0, 0 }, { 0, 1, 0, 1 }, { 0, 1, 1, 0 }, { 0, 1, 1, 1 }, { 1, 0, 0, 0 }, { 1, 0, 0, 1 }};
  ```
- Pronet Self Driving Car: The Pronet Self Driving car is the worlds first autonmous veichle code written in Python3 and uses no machine learning or artifical intelligence modules such as numpy or tensorflow. It can easily navigate obstacales and tough situations with ease, and along with the algoritm we have provided a pygame module based simulator.
  ```python
    poi1 = calculatePOI((x,y),(x+w,y), pt1, pt2) != False
  ```
 - PyBlock Module: The Pyblock module is revolutionizing the way users inteact with python. We have made it so much more easier to use and incorparte Python on a mass scale for consumers and companies to use.
   ```python
   # This is to install pip on OS
    def OS_PIP_INSTALL():
        import os
        # Will reboot the window
        os.system('pip install --upgrade pip')
        os.system('pip install wheel')
        os.system('pip install twine')
        os.system('python example_project/setup.py sdist bdist_wheel')
        os.system('twine upload dist/*')
   ```
