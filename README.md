# Welcome to Pronet's Github Page!
Hi everyone, I am Vihaan Mehta, a software programmer and a electrical hardware enthuisast. I mainly program in Python (pygame, flask, pymongo), C/C++, HTML, CSS, and Dart + Flutter. I spend a lot of time devolping and creating solutions using Arduino Microcontroller boards. In this profile, I program solutions and simplfy hard concepts to easy to manipulate interfaces. I also  make fun programs that showcase real world applications.
## Projects
- ANN Alpha: The ANN Alpha is a program that is revolutionizing the Machine Learning world. We have finally made the worlds first lightweight Machine Learning algorithm for microcontrollers. It is very easy to use and can be modified easily and customized per your needs.
  - [ANN-Alpha Project Page link](https://github.com/PronetAI/ANN-Alpha) 
  ```c
  const byte Target[PatternCount][Output_Nodes] = {{ 0, 0, 0, 0 }, { 0, 0, 0, 1 }, { 0, 0, 1, 0 }, { 0, 0, 1, 1 }, { 0, 1, 0, 0 }, { 0, 1, 0, 1 }, { 0, 1, 1, 0 }, { 0, 1, 1, 1 }, { 1, 0, 0, 0 }, { 1, 0, 0, 1 }};
  ```
- BASIC Transformer Interface: Throughout the late 80's the programming language BASIC was very popular and commonly used. Now it is rarely used and people barely care about it. THe reason is not because of the lack of interest, it is becuase of the user interaction. Becuase it requires heavy software and old computers to run on, it has made programming very difficult. Now we have created one of the easiest to use programming interface for BASIC and have made it super convient for users.
  - [Transic Project Page link](https://github.com/PronetAI/Transic) 
  ```python
  in=input(">>>")
  for item in dict_code():
    if in == item[10211]: print(str(item[4045])+' '+in[for items in in(3): print(items))
  ```
 - PyBlock Module: The Pyblock module is revolutionizing the way users inteact with python. We have made it so much more easier to use and incorparte Python on a mass scale for consumers and companies to use.
   - [PyBlock Project Page link](https://github.com/PronetAI/Pyblock-Module) 
   ```python
   # This is to install pip on OS
    def OS_PIP_INSTALL():
        import os
        # Will reboot the window
        os.system('pip install --upgrade pip')
        os.system('pip install wheel')
        os.system('pip install twine')
        os.system('python example_project/setup.py sdist bdist_wheel')
        os.system('twine upload dist/*')
   ```
